# Storyteller

Storyteller is an interactive, AI-powered narrative application. You take on the role of the storyteller or "Dungeon Master" (DM), guiding a cast of AI-driven characters through a collaborative tale. Provide a scenario, and watch as the characters react and build the story alongside you.

## How It Works

The application provides a simple interface for crafting a story:

1.  **DM Input**: As the DM, you write a prompt or a piece of the story in the main input box. This sets the scene for the characters.
2.  **Character Selection**: You can choose which characters are present for a given scene using the filter buttons at the top.
3.  **Advance the Story**:
    *   Click **"Advance All"** to have all selected characters react to your prompt.
    *   Click an individual character's **"Advance [Character Name]"** button to have only that character respond.
4.  **AI-Powered Responses**: Each character's response is generated by Google's Gemini AI, based on their unique personality (defined in their respective `.txt` files) and the story's history so far.
5.  **Interactive Feed**: The story unfolds in the main feed, grouping interactions by the characters present in each scene. You can even edit the generated text directly in the feed to fine-tune the narrative.

## Features

*   **Dynamic Storytelling**: Create unique narratives with AI characters that have distinct personalities and motivations.
*   **Selective Advancement**: Control the pace and focus of the story by advancing all characters at once or one at a time.
*   **Scene Management**: Easily manage which characters are involved in a scene.
*   **Editable History**: The entire story log is editable, giving you full creative control.
*   **Persistent Personas**: Characters (Sophia, Cayle, and Beverly) have their personalities and backstories loaded from `.txt` files, ensuring consistent behavior.

## Setup

To run this application, you need a Google Gemini API key.

1.  **Get an API Key**: Obtain an API key from Google AI Studio.
2.  **Configure the Key**: The application fetches the API key from a file named `api.key` in the root directory. Create this file and paste your API key into it.

    ```
    api.key
    ```

    Alternatively, you can hard-code the key by replacing `"YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"` in `script.js`.

3.  **Run**: Open `index.html` in a web browser. The application requires a local web server to fetch the `.txt` and `.key` files due to browser security policies (CORS).
